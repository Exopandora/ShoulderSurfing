- Updated to 1.21.11
  - IMPORTANT:
    The trident use animation was renamed from 'spear' to 'trident'.
    Users must manually update their existing configs to reflect that change.
    Affected config options are: `adaptive_crosshair_use_item_animations` and `adaptive_crosshair_hold_item_animations`.
- Added config option for defining adaptive crosshair item components which are present by default for when using or holding items
