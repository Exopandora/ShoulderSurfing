Shoulder Surfing Reloaded is a highly configurable third person camera mod for minecraft.

# Features #
* Over-the-shoulder camera - see what you are interacting with in 3rd person
* Decoupled camera - walk left and right without turning your mouse
* Free look (default: `left alt`) - keep walking in a direction while looking in a different one
* Hotkeys to move the camera (default: `arrow keys`, `page up` and `page down`, `o` to switch shoulders)
* Corrective cross-hair positioning when using adaptive or dynamic crosshair
* Adaptive player transparency - fades the player model to transparent when view is obstructed
* Highly configurable - customize your 3rd person experience with many configuration options
* Client side only - no server mods required

Please note that this mod modifies the camera position and player movement, which can be an issue for servers with strict anti-cheat.
Use at your own risk!

# FAQ #
**Q:** Why is the player not looking at the position of the crosshair when holding item x?  
**A:** This needs to be configured using the config options `adaptive_crosshair_hold_items` or `adaptive_crosshair_use_items`.

**Q:** Why is the player not rendered correctly when using shader pack x?  
**A:** This is caused by player transparency effects of Shoulder Surfing Reloaded. Either disable them in the config (`adjust_player_transparency`) and restart your game or report this to the authors of the shader pack.

**Q:** Can you port feature x to version y?  
**A:** No.

**Q:** Can you port this to quilt, liteloader, rift, etc.?  
**A:** No.

**Q:** Can I add this to my mod pack?  
**A:** Yes.
